                            I'm 20 years old this year.
                            When I was a child, I wanted to be a doctor (cliche, I know). As I grew up, I kept changing my dream job until I chose to study programming.
                            Generally, I like action combined with sci-fi or fantasy movies.
                            <br><br>
                            I once joined programming extracurricular in SHS but I didn't learn it seriously at that time.
                            Little did I know, it turned out that the 17-year-old me chose STEI, although at first I wanted to major in Chemical Engineering or Accounting.
                            I can't precisely say that I really love coding but I quite enjoy doing it.
                            </p>

                    <p>
                        Reading, writing, and watching are my hobbies.

                    <div id="div2" class="read-more">
                        <p>I like reading fantasy, sci-fi, and romance novels. 
                        My favorites are:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The Mortal Instrument series</li>
                            <li>Percy Jackson series</li>
                            <li>The Land of Stories series</li>

                        <p>
                            As for writing, I started it when I was in junior high school. I once won a fanfiction competition. 
                            I'm not actively writing anymore but sometimes I write short stories.
                            <br><br>
                            Other than those two, I also love watching films and TV series.

                    <p>
                        Programming is a new thing for me.

                        Yes, I knew it in high school but I don't really understand it at that time. 
                        The very first time I really have a hands-on experience was PTI class (it's called PengKom now).
                        It was hard at first but I came to enjoy working on it, even though the assignments are often stressful.
                        </p>

                        <p>Here are some projects that I've worked on during my time in Informatics Engineering:</p>

                            <li>Convex Hull Finder (C)</li>
                            <li>Keyword Extractor (Python)</li>
