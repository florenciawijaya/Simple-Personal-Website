                            I'm 20 years old this year and my mental age is 19 based on the mental age test from Internet.
                            When I was a child, I wanted to be a doctor (cliche, I know). As I grew up, I kept changing my dream job until I chose to study programming.
                            Generally, I like action combined with sci-fi or fantasy movies.
                            <br><br>
                            I once joined programming extracurricular in SHS but I didn't learn it seriously at that time (which really saddens me now). Actually, my first choice was either Chemical Engineering or Accounting.
                            Little did I know, it turned out that the 17-year-old me chose STEI. And so my study in programming started.
                            I can't precisely say that I really love coding but I quite enjoy doing it.

                    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
                    <p>
                        Reading, writing, and watching are my hobbies.
                        <br><br>

                    <div id="div2" class="read-more">
                        <p>I like reading fantasy, sci-fi, and romance novels but now I mostly only read stories on social media. 
                        My favorites are:
                        </p>

                        <ul>
                            <li>The Mortal Instrument series</li>
                            <li>Percy Jackson series</li>
                            <li>The Land of Stories series</li>
                            <li>Bliss series</li>
                            <li>Bumi series</li>
                        </ul>
                        
                        <p>
                            As for writing, I started it when I was in junior high school. I once won a fanfiction competition. Sadly, I stopped writing when I entered senior high school and haven't been writing seriously until now.
                            But now I'm trying to harness my writing skill again by trying to write short stories. 
                            <br><br>
                            Other than those two, I also love watching films and TV series.
                        </p>

                    <h2>TV Series</h2>
                    <p>
                        TV series help me get through boredom.
                        <br><br>
                    </p>

                        <p>
                        They also make me interested in a lot of things. For example, I once wanted to become a forensic anthropologist (thanks to Bones. It's great, you should watch it).
                        Criminal Minds brought me to the TV series world. Ever since then, I really like watching TV series, especially the crime or police procedural ones.
                        </p>

                        <p>Here are some TV series that I've watched:</p>
